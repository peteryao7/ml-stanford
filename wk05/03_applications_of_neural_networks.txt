Autonomous Driving Example

Autonomous driving - getting a car to learn to drive itself.

Dean Pomerleau - CMU: ALVINN
    - ALVINN is a series of neural networks that learns to steer by watching a person drive
    - lower left: the front view seen by the car
    - top: first horizontal bar shows direction selected by human driver, second
      bar shows steering direction selected by learning algorithm from NN
        - before the NN starts learning, the network is a gray band, meaning
          it started randomly initialized
        - then after learning, it outputs a solid white band that is more confidently
          selecting a band in one particular location

Training procedure for ALVINN
    - person drives as ALVINN watches
    - once every 2 seconds, ALVINN digitizes a video image of the road ahead, and records
      the steering direction
    - the training image is reduced to a 30x32 image as input for ALVINN's 3-layered network
    - BP trains ALVINN to produce output as the same steering direction as the 
      human driver for that image
    - at first it's random, but after 2 minutes ALVINN can imitate the steering reactions
    - then the process is repeated for other road types

Intersections
    - when a vehicle approaches an intersection, the confidence of the lone lane network decreases
    - when it crosses it and the 2-lane road comes into view, the confidence rises
    - then the 2-lane network is selected to steer and guide the vehicle

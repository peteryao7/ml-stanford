Multiclass Classification: One-vs-all Classification

Ex. Email foldering/tagging: Work, Friends, Family, Hobby
                              y=1    y=2      y=3    y=4

Ex. Medical Diagrams: Not ill, Cold, Flu
                        y=1     y=2  y=3

Ex. Weather: Sunny, Cloudy, Rain, Snow
              y=1     y=2    y=3   y=4

Can start at y=0

                x_1

Class 1: O
Class 2: □
Class 3: X

We can isolate each class and lump the others into the another "negative class"
Then we can just treat the problem as a linear regression problem.

h_θ^1(x) - has Os as positive class
h_θ^2(x) - has □s as positive class
h_θ^3(x) - has Xs as positive class
h_θ^(i)(x) = P(y=i|x;θ)

Train a logistic regression classifier h_θ^(i)(x) for each class i to predict
the probability that y=i.
On a new input x, to make a prediction, pick the class i that maximizes 
max_i h_θ^(i)(x).

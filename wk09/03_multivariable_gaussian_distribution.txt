Mutivariate Gaussian Distribution

This has advantages and disadvantages, and can catch anomalies that the previous
Gaussian distribution couldn't.

Say we have a 2D plot for x_1 (CPU load) and x_2 (memory use), then we can plot 2 Gaussian distributions 
as before with respect to x_1 and x_2. 

CPU load and memory use seem to grow linearly with each other, but we can see there's an anomaly
where there's a lot of memory use with little CPU load. However, if we plotted the anomaly on
the 2 Gaussian distributions, their probabilities aren't that different from what we've seen before,
so p(x_1;μ_1,σ_1^2) and p(x_2;μ_2,σ_2^2) will be rather high for the anomaly and not flag it as such.

Multivariate Gaussian (Normal) distribution

x ∈ R^n, don't model p(x_1), p(x_2), ... separately.
Model p(x) all in one go.
Params: μ ∈ R^n, Σ ∈ R^(n x n) (covariance matrix)

p(x;μ,Σ) = 1/ ((2*pi)^(n/2) * |Σ|^(1/2)) * exp(-1/2 * (x - μ)^T * Σ^-1(x-μ))
|Σ|^(1/2) is the determinant of a matrix, which can be found with det(Sigma)

Examples

2D
Let μ = [0;0] for all these examples.

Σ = [1 0;0 1]

For some specific value of x_1 and x_2, the height of the surface will be p(x).
p(x) is highest when x_1 = x_2 = 0, the peak of the Gaussian distribution.
The probability falls off on a bell-shaped surface.

Σ = [0.6 0;0 0.6]
Shrinking Σ increases the height of p(x) and narrows the bell shape as the area under should always be 1.

Σ = [2 0;0 2]
Enlarging Σ lowers the height of p(x) and widens the bell shape.

Σ = [0.6 0;0 1]
This reduces the variance of x_1 while keeping the variance of x_2 the same.

Σ = [2 0;0 1]
Conversely, this increases the variance of x_1 and can take on more values while x_2 stays the same. 
The distribution falls off more slowly as x_1 moves away from 0.

Σ = [1 0;0 0.6]
x_2 takes on a smaller range of values

Σ = [1 0;0 2]
x_2 takes on a larger range of values

Σ = [1 0.5;0.5 1]
If x_1 and x_2 are highly correlated with each other, you get a different type of Gaussian distribution.
The distribution gets more thinly peaked along the x=y line. 

Increasing the values of the off-diagonal makes the peak higher and narrower, while making the values
negative has the same behavior in the -x=y direction.

Changing μ will change the center of the peak, but not the behavior of the Gaussian distribution.

Problem Motivation of Anomaly Detection

Example:

Aircraft engine features: x_1 = heat generated, x_2 = vibration intensity ...
Dataset: {x^(1),x^(2),...,x^(m)}

Then we plot all the engines in an unlabeled plot.

Suppose you have a new engine x_test and you want to see if the engine is 
anomalous in any way and requires further testing.

If the engine is inside the cluster, then we think it's ok. 
If it were outside the cluster, then maybe it's an anomaly.

For model p(x), if p(x_test) < ε, flag as an anomaly
               if p(x_test) >= ε, OK

So it would be like rings, or contour lines, surrounding the central point
of the cluster of points. If the new point is 3 rings outside, then 
consider it an anomaly.

Fraud detection:
    - x^(i) = features of user i's activities
    - Model p(x) from data
    - Identify unusual users by checking which have p(x) < ε

Examples of anomaly detection:
    - detecting user behavior on your website, keeping track of pages visited, # transactions,
      typing speed etc.
        - if you find users as an anomaly by checking p(x) < ε, isolate them for further investigation
    - manufacturing

Monitoring computers in a data center
    x^(i) = features of machine i
    x_1 = memory use, x_2 = # of disk accesses/sec, x_3 = CPU load, x_4 = CPU load / network traffic etc.

If you're flagging too many things as an anomaly, decrease ε and make the restriction more strict.
If you're flagging no anomalies and can see them yourself, increase ε.

Problem Formulation

Recommender systems - one of the most important applications of ML and currently 
    has lots of room for improvement.

Amazon, Netflix, eBay, etc. have systems that try to recommend new products.
These recommendations are a substantial fraction of the products consumed by their users.
So an improvement in recommender performance can provide a substantial and immediate
impact on the bottom line of many of these companies ($$$). 

Also, as we approach near the end of the course, this is one of the few big ideas in ML.
The features you choose will have a big impact on performance of your learning algorithm.

Ex. predicting movie ratings

User rates movies using 0-5 stars

Movie                   | Alice(1)  Bob(2)  Carol(3)  Dave(4)
Love at Last                5         5        0        0
Romance Forever             5         ?        ?        0
Cute Puppies of Love        ?         4        0        ?
Nonstop Car Chases          0         0        5        4
Swords vs. Karate           0         0        5        ?

? - didn't watch
We have 3 romance/comedy movies and 2 action movies.
It looks like Alice and Bob give high ratings for romantic/comedies and low ratings for action movies, and
Carol and Dave are the opposite.

n_u = # users = 4
n_m = # movies = 5
r(i,j) = 1 if user j has rated movie i = 0 or 1
y(i,j) = rating given by user j to movie i (defined only if r(i,j) = 1) = 0 to 5

The recommender system problem is, given this data set and the r(i,j)s and y(i,j)s, to look through 
all the movie ratings that are missing and try to predict what the ?s will be.

Maybe Alice's ? will be 5 since she likes romances/comedies, Bob's ? will be 4.5 since he rated the movies
he likes 4 or 5, Carol's ? will be 0 as the other movies she rated in the category were 0, and Dave's ?
as 0 for the same reason.

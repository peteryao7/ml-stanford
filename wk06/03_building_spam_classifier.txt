Prioritizing What to Work On - ML System Design for a Spam Classifier

Two examples of spam vs. non-spam emails

Spam emails have:
    - suspicious e-mails and subjects
    - keywords for selling things (deal, buy)
    - misspelled words

vs. a non-spam email, like an email from a family member

Labels y=1 for spam and y=0 for non-spam.

Supervised learning for building a classifier to distinguish spam vs. non-spam

x = features of email
y = spam (1) or not spam (0)

Features x: Choose 100 words indicative of spam/not spam
    - deal, buy, discount, andrew, now, ...

Given a spam mail, we can take the list of words, sort them in lexicographical order,
and check if these words appear in the e-mail or not.

Then define a feature vector x of size 100x1 and if a word appears, set the index as 1,
if not, set as 0.

From: cheapsales@buystufffromme.com
To: ang@cs.standord.edu
Subject: Buy now!

Deal of the week! Buy now!

x = [ 0 ]     andrew
    [ 1 ]     buy
    [ 1 ]     deal
    [ 0 ]     discount
    [...]
    [ 1 ]     now

In practice, we'd take the most frequently occurring n words (10000 or 50000) in training
set, rather than manually picking 100 words.

How to spend your time to make it have low error?
    - collect lots of data
        - e.g. a "honeypot" project creates fake e-mail addresses to send to spammers
          for them to use, so the creators get tons of spam email to use for data to train
          their learning algorithms
    - develop sophisticated features based on email routing information (from email header)
        - when spammers send e-mail, they'll try to obscure the origins of the e-mail, or
          use fake e-mail headers, or send the e-mail through unusual routes
        - some of this info is reflected in the e-mail header
    - develop sophisticated features for the message body
        - should "discount" or "discounts" be treated as the same word?
        - what about "deal" or "Dealer"
        - punctuation?
    - develop sophisticated algorithm to detect misspellings
        - m0rtgage, med1cine, w4tches

It's difficult to see which one is the most helpful.

When working on a ML problem, it's helpful to brainstorm lists of different things to try
like above. Avoid focusing on one single problem or going with a gut feeling.

Reconstruction From Compressed Representation

After compressing data into a lesser dimensional feature vector through PCA, how
do you go back to your original representation?

-----

Say you have a 2D plot and you projected them onto a 1D surface, and now you only
need a real number for each point on z_1. How do we go back to our 2D space?
Can we map z ∈ R back to x ∈ R^2?

x_approx = U_reduce * z
U_reduce ∈ R^(n x k) and z ∈ R^k, so x_approx ∈ R^n

If the square projection error isn't too big, then x_approx ≈ x.

So you get back the 2D plot with every x^(i) directly on the line, instead of maybe
being slightly above or below it.

It's not perfect, but it's an approximation and lets you go back to your uncompressed
representation of the data. This process is called reconstruction of the original data.

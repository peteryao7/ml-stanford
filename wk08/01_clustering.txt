Unsupervised Learning: Introduction

In supervised learning, we're given a labeled training set and our goal is to
find a boundary separating the positive and negative labeled examples. We want
to fit a hypothesis to it.

In unsupervised learning, we're given data with no labels associated with it.
It's just a set of points and no labels mapped onto a graph of x_1 vs. x_2.
We're asking the algorithm to find some sort of structure to it.

In this case, it looks like we have 2 groups of points bunched together. Those
are clusters. We can use a clustering algorithm to identify clusters.

Applications of clustering
    - market segmentation
    - social network analysis, like looking at info of groups on FB or G+ or LI
    - organize computing clusters or data centers to find out how to design
      your network or data center communications
    - astronomical data analysis - galaxy formation

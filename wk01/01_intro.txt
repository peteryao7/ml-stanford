What is ML?
    Arthur Samuel (1959): Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn w/o being explicitly programmed

Def: Well-posed Learning Problem
    Tom Mitchell (1998): A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T 
    and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, measured by P, improves with experience E.

Example:
    Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that 
    learns how to better filter spam.

    T: classifying emails as spam/not spam
    E: watching you label emails as spam/not spam
    P: the # or fraction of emails correctly classified as spam/not spam

ML Examples:
    - Google ranking web pages from searches
    - FB/Apple recognizing friends in photos
    - E-mail/spam filter distinguishing spam from emails
    - Robots tidying up a house by demonstrating tasks and robots watching

AI Problem - building truly intelligent machines that humans can do
    How to make progress? Neural networks: mimic how the human brain works.

==================================================

Supervised Learning - All the correct answers are given

Regression problems - trying to predict results within a continuous output
Classification problems - trying to predict results in a discrete output, map input variables into discrete categories

Ex. Housing price prediction.
    - Size in ft^2 x-axis, price in 1000s y-axis
    - What line should be used to model the data?
        + e.g. linear, quadratic line

Def: regression - predict continuous valued output
    - in HPP, refers to price

Ex. Breast cancer prediction (malignant vs. benign)
    - tumor size x-axis, malignant? 0 no 1 yes y-axis
    - This is a classification problem, where there is a discrete-valued output (0 or 1)
        + Therefore, you can map the data to one line using different symbols to define 0 or 1 outputs
    
Ex. Tumor Size vs. Age
    - Given points of data indicating tumor size, age and says whether they're malignant/benign
    - Friend is a point
    - Can draw a line that will separate the groups of malignant/benign tumors to predict whether your friend has a malignant/benign tumor

Problem: Running a company, want to develop learning algs to address both problems:
    Problem 1: Have a large inventory of identical items. Want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next 3 months.
        Regression problem
    Problem 2: Want software to examine individual customer accounts, and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised.
        Classification problem

==================================================

Unsupervised Learning - here's a data set, can you find some kind of structure in it?

Useful for deriving structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables. 
Cluster data based on relationship among variables in data. No feedback based on prediction results.

Google News - clustering algorithm
    - Looks at 100000s of news stories on the web, groups them into cohesive news stories
    - Can click on different links in the group to get related articles on the same story

Genomics - clustering algorithm
    - Measure how much of certain genes are expressed
    - Colors measure how much the individual has of a certain type of gene
    - Can you arrange these individuals into clusters?

Other applications of clustering/unsupervised learning
    - Organize computer clusters
    - Social network analysis - given knowledge about what friends you message the most, can we identify what groups of people identify as friends?
    - Market segmentation - can you look at this customer data set and group your customers into different market segments to more efficiently sell products?
    - Galaxy formation

Cocktail party - non-clustering unsupervised learning algorithm
    - Large group of people talking amongst themselves, might be hard to hear each other
    - Can separate two people counting from 1-10 in Spanish/English at microphones at 2 different distances
    - Can separate one person counting and background music
    - This process can be done with one line of code in Octave (alternative to MATLAB).

        [W,s,v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x,1), size(x,1),1).*x)*x');

Problem: Which examples would you use an unsupervised learning algorithm?
    1. Given email labeled as spam/not spam, learn a spam filter.
        No, because you already know what category the email is in and can predict a result based off of that.
        This is a classification supervised learning problem.
    2. Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into sets of articles about the same stories.
        Yes, this is similar to the Google News example.
    3. Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments.
        Yes, this is the market segmentation example.
    4. Given a dataset of patients diagnosed as either having diabetes or not, learn to classify new patients as having diabetes or not.
        No, you're given "the correct answers" to the problem already and want to predict results based on those.
        This is a classification supervised learning problem.

Matrices are 2D arrays.

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]
[j k l]

^ is a 4x3 matrix (row x col).

A vector is a matrix with one column.

[w]
[x]
[y]
[z]

^ is a 4x1 matrix, or a 4-dimensional vector.

A_ij refers to the ith row and jth col of matrix A.
All vectors and matrices in this course is 1-indexed, so the first element is at index 1.
A scalar is a single value, not an object like a vector or matrix.
R refers to the set of scalar real numbers.
R^n refers to the set of n-dimensional vectors of real numbers.

Octave notation:
    Initialize a 4x3 matrix A. ; denotes a new row.
        A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9; 10, 11, 12]
    Initialize a vector.
        v = [1;2;3]
    Get dimension of matrix A where m = rows, n = cols
        [m,n] = size(A) => m = 4, n = 3
        dim_A = size(A) => 4   3
        dim_v = size(v) => 3   1
    Index into 2nd row 3rd col of matrix A
        A_23 = A(2,3) => 6

Addition and Scalar Multiplication

[a b] + [w x] = [a+w b+x]
[c d] + [y z] = [c+y d+z] => same for subtraction

[a b] * x = [a*x b*x]
[c d]       [c*x d*x] => same for division

Octave notation:
    Initializes matrices A, B
        A = [1, 2, 4; 5, 3, 2]
        B = [1, 3, 4; 1, 1, 1]
    Initialize constant s
        s = 2
    Addition and subtraction
        add_AB = A + B
        sub_AB = A - B
    Multiplication and division
        mult_As = A * s
        div_As = A / s => note this returns double values up to 5 decimal places
    Add scalar to matrix
        add_As = A + s => adds s to every value in matrix

Matrix-Vector Multiplication

[a b] * [x] = [a*x + b*y]
[c d] * [y] = [c*x + d*y]
[e f]       = [e*x + f*y]

The result is a 3x1 vector.

m x n matrix multiplied by an n x 1 vectors results in a m x 1 vector.

Can multiply a matrix and vector the same way as with a scalar.

----------

Matrix-Matrix Multiplication

[a b] * [w x] = [a*w+b*y a*x+b*z]
[c d] * [y z] = [c*w+d*y c*x+d*z]
[e f]         = [e*w+f*y e*x+f*z]

The result is a 3x2 matrix.

To better visualize, go through rows on matrix 1 and cols on matrix 2,
the value goes to the intersecting index.

m x n matrix multiplied by n x p matrix results in a m x p matrix.
The # cols in matrix 1 must equal the # rows in matrix 2.

Can multiple 2 matrices the same way as with a scalar.

Matrix Multiplication Properties

Matrices are not commutative, but they are associative.

The identity matrix has 1s on the main diagonal and 0s everywhere else.

[1 0 0]
[0 1 0]
[0 0 1]

Octave notation:
    Initialize a 2x2 identity matrix
        I = eye(2)

----------

Inverse and Transpose

The inverse of a matrix A is denoted A^(-1).
Multiplying A by its inverse gives the identity matrix.
A non-square matrix cannot have an inverse.
    Matrices with no inverse are singular.

To find the transpose, hoist values from col n up to row n.

A = [a b]
    [c d]
    [e f]

A^T = [a c e]
      [b d f]

A_ij = (A^T)_ji

Octave notation:
    Initialize matrix A
        A = [1,2,0;0,5,6;7,0,9]
    Transpose A
        A_trans = A'
    Take inverse of A
        A_inv = inv(A) (pinv(A) in Octave)
    Multiplying A by A_inv gives eye(3)
        A_invA = inv(A)*A => trailing zeros from multiplying decimals and -0 from roundoff

Summary and Thank You

Main topics:

Supervised Learning
    - linear regression, logistic regression, neural networds, SVMs
    - for labeled data (x^(i),y^(i))

Unsupervised Learning
    - K-means, PCA, anomaly detection
    - for unlabeled data x^(i)
    - anomaly detection can also use labeled data to evaluate the algorithm

Special applications/special topics
    - recommender systems, large scale machine learning

Advice on building a ML system
    - bias/variance, regularization
    - deciding what to work on next
        - evaluation of learning algorithms, learning curves (training/CV/test sets), error analysis, 
          ceiling analysis
